1. Complex NMR experiments can be recorded in an automated way. The user selects the experiments by simply browsing into a Jython emulated frame. All spectrometer dependent parameters are set automatically. A dialog window allows the user to define a few sample dependent parameters, and to select between different options.
2. Shaped pulse parameters (pulse length, power level, and frequency offsets) are calculated within the pulse sequence*. If necessary, the spectroscopically relevant parameters (excitation offset and band widths in ppm) are made accessible to the users via constants.
3. The NMR experiments can be easily shared between several NMR instruments (via an NFS mounting point for example). This allows easy maintenance and further development of the library.
4. The IBS pulse sequence package also contains tools that allow you to create your own templates that will be automatically included in the GUI starting from a successful NMR experiment. The created python scripts can then be used on other spectrometers or shared with other users.
